For registered user, after sing in will open his profile page in which he can update his information. For user has an “ADMIN” role can open the students list page where the admin can perform more options like remove a student.
The backend of the application using SpringBoot(Spring MVC, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security) and frontend using standard HTML and Java script in which using Ajax (XMLHttpRequest) to communicate with the backend. Data exchange format is JSON.

2.1 front end
Front end is based on HTML and JavaScript, no third party framework is used.

2.2 backend
Backend is Spring boot Maven project running with JDK 1.8, including Spring framework, Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA. If you want to run the application, improt pms file into any IDE  like eclipse and intelij and import maven project, after that, run the sms application in java/com/bit//pms/ folder to start spring boot, then open localhost:8888 to start the web page
 

1) configuration file
application.properties is the main configuration file of Spring boot project, currently we create a DB called “px”, change this name if you create a different one. and also set u own database password in datasource.bitapp.password

3.	Functional Features
The application meets the functional features required in the assessment detailed as below.
3.1 Sing up
 
Click “new user?” on the index page to open the register page 
 
User should input all the fields because they are required, and also each field has validation.
3.2 login
 
By input the email and password, the user can login. If it is a normal user and successfully login will direct to the profile page in which can update some of his information, if login as admin will direct to student list page.
 
3.3 admin space and ability to manage data
For admin, the admin name is configured in property file and also persist in DB. Only the user has “ROLE_ADMIN” has the access to student list and student add pages. 
After admin login will direct to student list page 
 
On student list page, the admin can delete a user or add new user

3.4 logout
By clicking the Logout button on the top-right, will direct to the index page. 

3.5 form validation
For the student add page, we add some basic validation as below:

Last name	Required

Email	Required 

Match Email format
Password	Required 
minlength is 4
maxlength is 8

3.6 Email based password reset
If a registered user forget the password, can click the link to reset:
First step need to input the Email:
 	
Only if the user input Email is valid (not empty, match Email pattern and is registered in our application) will the “Send” button enabled. From the implementation perspective, when the input on blur, a request will be sent to backend with the input Email and check the Database if it is an Email already registered in the application. If it is the button will be enable and use can click, after that will get an alert that a password reset message was sent to the input Email.
 
Open your Email box and will see some message like below:
 
Click the link in the Email will open the password reset page as below:
 
Input the new password and press “Reset” button, if success will get a notice and redirect to login page. Then user can use the new password to login.

3.7 integration with public web service
use goggle map api to show our location on goggle map


3.8 expose a useful RESTful API
The application exposes a RESTful API to get the current system date and time:
Endpoint: /api/sys/datetime
 


3.9 deployment to cloud
Deployed in AWS (EC2 server and MySQL DB)

4.	Non-functional features
